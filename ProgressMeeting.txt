New instructions TALON:	
	Understand the latency on streaming over mmWave (VR video)
		Jakob has a model we should test?
	
	Assemble test bed -> Goal is to enable frame-by-frame streaming
	
	More detailed time line for setup. 
	
	
	Beamforming latency vs direct link?
	Blockage + movement and check impact on latency etc
		--> These are factors that happen in use as a VR link, so must be acceptable performance
	
	Hard to modify beamforming behaviour on any router, so not really available on talon.
	
	Mail Maria for routing. 
		Before meeting, send IPs/configuration.
	
	
	Evaluate in VR frame-to-frame, judge performance.
		More specific than iperf, apply real-world scenario.
		
	Judge mac layer by performance in application layer data. App layer is bursty (vr frames), mac layer loss is not sufficient
	
	
	
	ROUTING FAILURE: Ff checken.
