Hi Pieter,

I am not sure if you have already checked anything with the two Talon routers you got last week.

Here I give you a couple of notes regarding them:

They have LEDE (https://github.com/seemoo-lab/lede-ad7200) installed, which is basically a linux-based command line OS.
To connect to them you need to do it through the ethernet port with ssh: ssh root@ip
Currently the ips of the ethernet interfaces of the routers are 192.168.100.2 and 192.168.200.2 (I set them to different subnets as I was doing some experiments, feel free to change them)
In order to start the 60GHz wireless link, hostapd -B /etc/hostapd.conf (you will see the interface LED switch on)
When you start the 60GHz, it will not have an ip assigned (this is a drawback), so, you will need to set an address to it with: ifconfig wlan2 192.168.XXX.XXX
As you are using one laptop connected with two different ethernets, you will need to route the traffic to make sure that it goes through the 60GHz link. You can use the sudo ip commands
A trick to know if the traffic goes through the 60GHz is to do a ping between the interfaces in the laptop and see that the delay is roughly 300 ms.
 

If you have any questions, just let me know. After you have that settled, we can think about the streaming application.

 

Best regards,

Maria
