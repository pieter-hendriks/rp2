-> UDP channel for video frames
-> TCP control channel
-> Use TCP control channel to report UDP performance
	--> This over TCP video frames because re-transmitting failed frame is generally not worth it
	--> Causes increases in latency that are undesirable - would prefer to simply have data be out of date for 1 frame and update it in the next one.
	--> Need some mechanism of ensuring frame data gets updated though - if some blocks get dropped repeatedly - bad experience.
